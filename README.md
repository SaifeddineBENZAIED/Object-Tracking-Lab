# Object Tracking Lab

This repository contains two main projects focused on **object tracking**:
1. **Segmentation-Based Object Tracking**: Track objects using segmentation and bounding boxes.
2. **Feature-Based Tracking**: Track objects using feature extraction techniques like Harris Corner and Shi-Thomasi.
3. **MeanShift and CamShift Tracking**: Implement MeanShift and CamShift algorithms for object tracking.
